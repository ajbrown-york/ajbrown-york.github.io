                    It seems to be a quiet day at the Piazza: there aren't that many students and staff around
                    this time of the year, so most of the kitchen staff are away on leave - you only have three
                    cooks. Suddenly, a crowd bursts into the restaurant: it's an open day, and they all want to eat
                    at once! Make the most of your kitchen and your staff, and face up to the challenge of
                    serving an impatient and demanding crowd! (CHANGE AS THIS IS JUST THE PRODUCT BRIEF FOR NOW)
