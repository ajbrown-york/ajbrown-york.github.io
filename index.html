                    In the first week, we all met for the first time.
                    As a group, we went through the product brief and the deliverables.
                    Then, we organised a schedule of meeting every monday for 3-4 hours.
                    Finally, we brainstormed some initial ideas and came up with the group name
                    of "Broken-Designers" and used an AI to generate our logo.

                Laura and Rebecca used the questions we brainstormed as a group and made scenarios
                and a schedule to help with our first customer interview. Adam made the website framework
                and made the repositories for our game and website. Ollie and Morgan made a start finding
                the engine we would use for our game, eventually landing on LibGDX.

            Adam is going to keep the website updated and write the first two parts of the 
            architecture essay, as well as be on hand to help with the implementation.
            Rebecca is going to focus on the management essays and making more Gantt charts,
            as well as update them as time goes on. Laura will focus on writing up the 
            research requirements. Shabari will finish off the architecture essay and help
            with the implementation of the game, as well as help Laura research for the
            research requirements essay. Morgan will create the UML's for our implementation
            and help Ollie who is going to lead the development of the game.

                We decided to work over Christmas, but due to other exams, the work flow slowed. We still managed to make good progress on the game, with Ollie adding movement and collision.
                The risk register was also updasted and nearly filled. Morgan made about 6 final UMLS for the architecture deliverable and also made the mechanics of making items in our
                game.

                Additionally, Adam wrote 2 out the 3 pages for our architecture report, which was then finished by Shabari.
                Adam and Rebecca wrote the implementation report. Rebecca also finished the method selction and planning section.
                Laura remade the sprites for our game, and also finished the requirements section. Also changed our logo to Glibbert,
