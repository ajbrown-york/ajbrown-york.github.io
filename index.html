                    It seems to be a quiet day at the Piazza: there aren't that many students and staff around
                    this time of the year, so most of the kitchen staff are away on leave - you only have three
                    cooks. Suddenly, a crowd bursts into the restaurant: it's an open day, and they all want to eat
                    at once! Make the most of your kitchen and your staff, and face up to the challenge of
                    serving an impatient and demanding crowd!

                    In the first week, we all met for the first time.
                    As a group, we went through the product brief and the deliverables.
                    Then, we organised a schedule of meeting every monday for 3-4 hours.
                    Finally, we brainstormed some inital ideas and came up with the group name
                    of "Broken-Designers" and used an AI to generate our logo

                In week two, we decided to make a plan and split our group into three main roles.
                Laura and Rebecca used the questions we brainstormed as a group and made scenarios
                and a schedule t ohelp with our first customer interview. Adam made the website framework
                and made the repositories for our game and website. Ollie and Morgan made a start finding
                the engine we would use for our game, eventually landing on LibGDX.

            This week, We planned a lot of what we were going to do over the christmas break.
            Adam is going to keep the website updated and write the first two parts of the 
            architecture essay, as well as be on hand to help with the implementation.
            Rebecca is going to focus on the management essays and making more Gannt charts,
            as well as update them as time goes on. Laura will focus on writing up the 
            research requirments. Shabari will finish off the architecture essay and help
            with the implementation of the game, as well as help Laura research for the
            research requirments essay. Morgan will create the UML's for our implementation
            and help Ollie who is going to lead the development of the game.

                We decided to work over Christmas, but due to other exams, the work flow slowed. We still mangaged to make good progress on the game, adding movement and collision.

                This week, we decided to focus fully on implementation. All members

                such as audio or a title sceen.The risk assessment deliverable was finished 
                and the website has been touched up to include UMLS.
