                    It seems to be a quiet day at the Piazza: there aren't that many students and staff around
                    this time of the year, so most of the kitchen staff are away on leave - you only have three
                    cooks. Suddenly, a crowd bursts into the restaurant: it's an open day, and they all want to eat
                    at once! Make the most of your kitchen and your staff, and face up to the challenge of
                    serving an impatient and demanding crowd! (CHANGE AS THIS IS JUST THE PRODUCT BRIEF FOR NOW)

                    In the first week, we all met for the first time.
                    As a group, we went through the product brief and the deliverables.
                    Then, we organised a schedule of meeting every monday for 3-4 hours.
                    Finally, we brainstormed some inital ideas and came up with the group name
                    of "Broken-Designers" and used an AI to generate our logo

                In week two, we decided to make a plan and split our group into three main roles.
                Laura and Rebecca used the questions we brainstormed as a group and made scenarios
                and a schedule t ohelp with our first customer interview. Adam made the website framework
                and made the repositories for our game and website. Ollie and Morgan made a start finding
                the engine we would use for our game, eventually landing on LibGDX.
