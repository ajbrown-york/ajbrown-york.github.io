    <!--The following is the area in which we will complete our weekly progress report. Each week follows the same pattern so I will describe the first week. 
        "week_x_stuff" is the container class, "week_x_stuff_header" is the header class, "Week_paragraph" is the conatiner of the paragraph and "Week_1_image" is the container of the image.
        Due to the differing amount of work each week, some of these classes cannot be abstract as they take differing amounts of room on the webpage-->

                        In the first week, we all met for the first time.
                        As a group, we went through the product brief and the deliverables.
                        Then, we organised a schedule of meeting every monday for 3-4 hours.
                        Finally, we brainstormed some initial ideas and came up with the group name
                        of "Broken-Designers" and used an AI to generate our logo.

                    In week two, we decided to make a plan and split our group into three main roles.
                    Laura and Rebecca used the questions we brainstormed as a group and made scenarios
                    and a schedule to help with our first customer interview. Adam made the website framework
                    and made the repositories for our game and website. Ollie and Morgan made a start finding
                    the engine we would use for our game, eventually landing on LibGDX.

                This week, we planned a lot of what we were going to do over the christmas break.
                Adam is going to keep the website updated and write the first two parts of the 
                architecture essay, as well as be on hand to help with the implementation.
                Rebecca is going to focus on the management essays and making more Gantt charts,
                as well as update them as time goes on. Laura will focus on writing up the 
                research requirements. Shabari will finish off the architecture essay and help
                with the implementation of the game, as well as help Laura research for the
                research requirements essay. Morgan will create the UML's for our implementation
                and help Ollie who is going to lead the development of the game.

                    We decided to work over Christmas, but due to other exams, the work flow slowed. We still managed to make good progress on the game, with Ollie adding movement and collision.
                    The risk register was also updasted and nearly filled. Morgan made about 6 final UMLS for the architecture deliverable and also made the mechanics of making items in our
                    game.

                    We didn't make any progress on the project this week. This was because all members of the group had exams,
                    making it hard to make progress on the project

                    This week, we decided to focus fully on implementation. All members
                    that were able to work on the game were delegated parts to work on, 
                    such as audio or a title sceen.The risk assessment deliverable was finished 
                    and the website has been touched up to include UMLS.

                    This week, Ollie and Morgan merged their code, which meant our game now has functional items and stations.
                    Additionally, Adam wrote 2 out the 3 pages for our architecture report, which was then finished by Shabari.
                    Adam and Rebecca wrote the implementation report. Rebecca also finished the method selction and planning section.
                    Laura remade the sprites for our game, and also finished the requirements section. Also changed our logo to Glibbert,
                    the chef in our game.
